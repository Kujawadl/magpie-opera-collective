Riley Cameron is a recent graduate from Webster University and is now a first-year teacher in the SLPS district! Cameron has been performing for almost as long as he can remember, and he has absolutely loved getting to work on this program with everything involved. Cameron is also originally from Kenosha, Wisconsin, and his favorite St. Louis thing he has done is definitely getting to see free shows at The Muny.
