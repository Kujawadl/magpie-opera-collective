## About Magpie Opera Collective

Magpie Opera Collective is dedicated to bringing innovative opera performances to new audiences. Our mission is to celebrate creativity and collaboration in the world of opera.
Magpie Opera Collective is a new artist-run organization based in St. Louis, MO, founded in 2025 by Calista Goldwasser, Stephanie Mossinghoff, Jessica Barnes, and Kelly Beekman. United by a shared vision, these artists established the collective to create a vibrant platform for talented up-and-coming performers, composers, and creators in the region. Magpie is committed to fostering a supportive community where artists can collaborate, experiment, and bring fresh perspectives to the world of opera.

Through innovative programming and a focus on inclusivity, Magpie Opera Collective aims to highlight the diverse voices shaping the future of opera. The organization is dedicated to engaging new audiences, celebrating creativity, and providing opportunities for emerging artists to shine. By championing collaboration and artistic risk-taking, Magpie seeks to redefine what opera can be for St. Louis and beyond.
