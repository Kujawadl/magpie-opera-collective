Baritone Javi Ojeda is a first-year master’s student at Ball State University, originally from Edwardsville, Illinois, just outside of St. Louis. Before beginning graduate studies, he became an active presence in the St. Louis opera community, performing regularly with Winter Opera St. Louis, Union Avenue Opera, and SIUE Opera Theater. His stage experience includes roles such as Harry in My Fair Lady, the Second Armored Man in Die Zauberflöte, Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, Antonio in Le Nozze di Figaro, and Uberto in La Serva Padrona. In addition to his operatic work, Javi sang with the Schola Cantorum of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, where he appeared as a soloist in Puccini’s Messa di Gloria, Handel’s Messiah, and Fauré’s Requiem.
