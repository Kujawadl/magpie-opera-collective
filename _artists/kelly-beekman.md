Kelly N. Beekman is a mezzo-soprano based in St. Louis, Missouri. She graduated from Webster University with a Bachelor of Arts in Music, focusing on training her voice in both operatic and contemporary singing styles. While at Webster, she was a recipient of the Christine Brewer Annual Scholarship in Vocal Music Performance and she received departmental honors for her tireless dedication to her craft and her outstanding performances. She has been selected by The Bach Society of St. Louis to represent their young artist program for three consecutive seasons and currently holds that position. She has had the privilege to represent other local music organizations such as Union Avenue Opera (*Eugene Onegin*, 2022 and *Carmen*, 2024; Chorus) and Winter Opera St. Louis (*Manon Lescaut*, *Naughty Marietta*, 2024 and *H.M.S. Pinafore*, *Anna Bolena*, 2025; Chorus). 

Kelly is a founding member of Magpie Opera Collective, a local arts organization dedicated to providing opportunities and performance experience to early-career classical vocalists. While she is a classically trained artist, she specializes in multiple genres. Outside of the classical realm, Kelly is currently a back-up singer for the local funk-rock band “Eldraco and Free Nation.” She was the frontwoman for her own rock band for five years and she still writes and records her own contemporary music.
